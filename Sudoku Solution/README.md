# Sudoku Solution Using Threads
## Description
A Sudoku puzzle uses a 9 × 9 grid in which each column and row, as well as each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids, must contain all of the digits 1...9. This project consists of designing a multithreaded application that determines whether the solutionto a Sudoku puzzle is valid.

## Basic idea
To check if the Sudoku solution is correct or not, we need to check all of its columns, rows and 3x3 boxes if they contain all the numbers from 1 to 9.cIf all of them contain numbers from 1 to 9 then the solution is valid. Otherwise it is invalid.
